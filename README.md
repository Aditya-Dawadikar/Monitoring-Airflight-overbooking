# Monitoring-Airflight-overbooking

This project consist of 2 files which run independently.
1.simulator.py
2.metafile_ticket.py

The aim of the project was to caluculate the optimum price of the ticket for airline companies so that they can overbook the seats and still earn maximum revenue from the flight.
Simple Binomial Distribution helped solving the problem. 
The program output is a range of numbers that shows us the amout of profit that can be earned if we overbook by X number of seats.

metafile_ticket.py displays the minimum ticket price that can guarantee the profit.
simulator.py must be provided the required fields along with the ticket price which was generated by the metafile_ticket.py , any amount over minimum price will generate guarantted profit and the output can be plotted as a normal graph where the peak displays the maximum profit position.
